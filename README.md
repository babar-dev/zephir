# Goals
Allow a customer to :
- Provide his email address;
- Upload a photo;
- View his stats;
- Protect his datas with a password.

# NBs
- There's some real issues in the import of vendor CSS files. This is a ngbp problem. The native method never worked, and sometimes import them as we do for our own CSS files doesn't work either. The workaround consists in making symbolic links to the vendor files and import them in main.less.
